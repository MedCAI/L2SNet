# L2SNet for AutoPET-II challenge

## 1. Introduction

Flouro Deoxy Glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) is considered the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring the treatment responses in various cancers, such as lung cancer and melanoma [9]. This choice arises from PET/CTâ€™s ability to leverage the high sensitivity of PET in localizing abnormal tissue function and the specificity of CT in mapping lesions. Tumor segmentation is an essential step in PET/CT quantitative analysis. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and complicated in the clinic, which limits the effect of PET/CT examination. Fortunately, the development of deep learning gives rise to many automatic tumor segmentation algorithms, which have achieved promising performance in whole-body PET/CT image segmentation.

Despite the availability of advanced methods, precise tumor segmentation in PET/CT images remains a challenging task, for two significant reasons: (i) The small size of most tumors poses a difficulty for localizing these abnormal regions (shown in the first sample of Fig. 1). (ii) As shown in the second sample of Fig. 1, some tumors are adjacent to normal high-uptake regions, causing existing segmentation methods to over-segment the abnormal regions and incorporate areas such as normal high-uptake organs, inflammation, and other infections into the identified tumor regions. Hence, a segmentation method that can accurately localize the tumors and outline their boundaries is urgent for PET/CT image analysis.
